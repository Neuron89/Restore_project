turn this idea in a full backup/restore software but lightweight and open source. 

two versions of the software 
   - gui
      -look like lazygit(i like how that looks)
   - terminal
add functionality to check which system you are using 
  -hopefully be able to run on linux and windows
create multiple curl commands to create entire install scripts from a bootloader
enable an ability to sync between machines (git push/pull like option)
have automated backup scheduling
